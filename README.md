# A quick project to add a filtering layer on top of Fillout Form submission responses API

Note:
Make sure you update the API key for Fillout in `.env` file

Start the server with the command "npm start"

You can get the form submission responses by reaching out to `http://localhost:3000/responses/{FORM_ID}/filteredResponses` for a specific form ID and can filter the form responses
